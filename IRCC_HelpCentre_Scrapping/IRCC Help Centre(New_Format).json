For an adopted person to be eligible for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons at least one of the adoptive parents must be a Canadian citizen at the time of the adoption, or, for adoptions that took place prior to January\u00a01, 1947, at least one adoptive parent must have become a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 (or April\u00a01, 1949, in the case of Newfoundland and Labrador for adoptions that took place prior to April\u00a01, 1949) and be able to pass on Canadian citizenship to the adopted person. Other types of custody arrangements and adoption-like situations (guardianships) do not meet the requirements for a direct grant of citizenship for adopted persons. The adoptive parent must be eligible to pass on citizenship by descent.\nIf you choose to apply for citizenship through the direct grant of citizenship, your child will be affected by the first-generation limit to citizenship by descent. That means they will not be able to:\n\npass on their citizenship to any children they may have outside Canada; or\napply for a direct grant for any children they later adopt outside Canada, unless the co-sponsor for the adoption is a Canadian citizen by birth in Canada or through naturalization.\n\nBoth Canadian citizens and permanent residents can use the immigration process for their adopted children if the adopted person is going to live in Canada right after the adoption.\nAnother difference between the two processes is the adopted child does not have to undergo a medical exam or background checks when applying for a direct grant of citizenship. These are  requirements when applying for permanent residence.\nWhere the requirements are the same for both types of applications, the adoption must:\n\nbe in the best interests of the child;\ncreate a genuine parent-child relationship that permanently severs the legal ties to the child\u2019s biological parents;\naccord with the laws of the country where the adoption took place and the laws where the adoptive parents live; and\nnot have been entered into primarily to get a citizenship or immigration status or privilege.\n\nIf the adoption took place after the person turned 18:\n\nall the requirements listed above must be met (except for the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d);\na genuine parent-child relationship must have existed when the adoption took place; and\nthat relationship must have existed before the adopted person turned 18.\n\nIn addition to these requirements, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act introduced a new requirement for direct grants of citizenship for adopted persons that the adoption must not have occurred in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions.\n"

Her husband Diego will co-sign the application to help her meet the income requirement. They married in 2021 and have no children. \nAngel must calculate her family size on a yearly basis. Since co-signers must be included in all years, she must include Diego in the family size for all 3 years even though they married in 2021.

Maria is single and has no children. Her mother has been married to Oleg (Maria\u2019s stepfather) since 2009. Oleg has a 15 year old son, Alexei (Maria\u2019s stepbrother). Maria\u2019s stepfather and stepbrother will not come to Canada with Irina.\nMaria must calculate her family size on a yearly basis. She must include all family members, even those not coming to Canada. \nFor 2021, 2020 and 2019, Maria\u2019s family size is 4:\n\nMaria\nMaria\u2019s mother, Irina\nMaria\u2019s stepfather, Oleg\nMaria\u2019s stepbrother, Alexei\n\nMaria includes her stepfather and stepbrother because they are Irina\u2019s dependants (her spouse and dependent child) even though they\u2019re not coming to Canada. \nFor all 3 years (2021, 2020 and 2019), Maria must check if she meets the income requirement for 4 persons. \n\n\n\nExample 5 \u2014 Sponsor with a separated spouse \n\nJuan and Lise, who are both permanent residents, are married and had a child in 2019.

Juan\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t have any dependants.\nFor 2021, 2020 and 2019, Juan\u2019s family size is 4:\n\nJuan\nJuan\u2019s spouse, Lise (even though they\u2019re separated)\nJuan and Lise\u2019s child\nJuan\u2019s mother\n\nEven though Juan and Lise separated in 2021, they\u2019re still legally married. Lise counts towards the family size until they\u2019re divorced.\nFor all 3 years (2021, 2020 and 2019), Juan must check if he meets the income requirement for 4 persons.\n\n\n\nExample 6 \u2014 Principal applicant with a separated spouse \n\nKabir is sponsoring his mother, Naya, and will submit his application in 2022. He has no dependants. Naya separated from her husband, Jai, in 1995. Neither Naya nor Jai are in a common-law relationship with another person.\nFor 2021, 2020 and 2019, Kabir\u2019s family size is 3:\n\nKabir\nKabir\u2019s mother, Naya\nNaya\u2019s spouse, Jai (even though they\u2019re separated)\n\nEven though Naya and Jai separated in 1995, they\u2019re still legally married. Jai counts towards the family size until \n\nthey\u2019re divorced or \none of them enters a common-law relationship with another person \n\nFor all 3 years (2021, 2020 and 2019), Kabir must check if he meets the income requirement for 3 persons.\n\n\n\nExample 7 \u2014 Principal applicant with a separated spouse and a common-law partner\n\nFatima is sponsoring her father Yusuf and will be submitting an application in 2022.

On March 13, 2013, you may be eligible for deemed rehabilitation.\nI have one conviction, for which I am serving three years of probation. Can I apply for rehabilitation after my probation ends?\nYes, but you must wait five years after your sentence ends.

These are  requirements when applying for permanent residence.\nWhere the requirements are the same for both types of applications, the adoption must:\n\nbe in the best interests of the child;\ncreate a genuine parent-child relationship that permanently severs the legal ties to the child\u2019s biological parents;\naccord with the laws of the country where the adoption took place and the laws where the adoptive parents live; and\nnot have been entered into primarily to get a citizenship or immigration status or privilege.\n\nIf the adoption took place after the person turned 18:\n\nall the requirements listed above must be met (except for the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d);\na genuine parent-child relationship must have existed when the adoption took place; and\nthat relationship must have existed before the adopted person turned 18.\n\nIn addition to these requirements, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act introduced a new requirement for direct grants of citizenship for adopted persons that the adoption must not have occurred in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions.\n"

I did not serve any time in prison and I have had no other convictions. Will I be allowed to enter Canada?\nAn immigration officer or border services officer may find you rehabilitated under a system called deemed rehabilitation. This system applies to people who, in most cases, have one previous conviction over 10 years ago. If an immigration officer deems you rehabilitated, you will likely be allowed to enter Canada, as long as you meet all other requirements.\nOn June 3, 2003, I was convicted of driving under the influence and had my driver's licence taken away for three years. When can I apply for rehabilitation?\nYour sentence\u2014which included the period your licence was suspended\u2014ended on June 3, 2006. Count five years from the end date of the suspension or the date your driver's licence was reinstated. That shows you can apply for rehabilitation on June 3, 2011.\nI was convicted of a crime on December 13, 2002. I received a jail sentence of three months. When can I apply for rehabilitation?\nYou can apply for individual rehabilitation five years after the end of your sentence. If your three-month jail sentence ended on March 13, 2003, you have been eligible to apply for rehabilitation since March 13, 2008, unless other terms\u2014such as parole or probation\u2014were imposed on your sentence.  On March 13, 2013, you may be eligible for deemed rehabilitation.\nI have one conviction, for which I am serving three years of probation. Can I apply for rehabilitation after my probation ends?\nYes, but you must wait five years after your sentence ends.

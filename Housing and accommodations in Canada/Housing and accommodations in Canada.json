            "subheading": "Housing terms in Canada",
            "content": "When you choose private housing, you\u2019ll need to know the definitions of housing terms that are common and unique to Canada.Bachelor apartment: An apartment comprised of 1 large room that acts as your bedroom and living room. It includes a kitchen area and bathroom.Duplex: A building that contains 2 living spaces or apartments.Single-detached: A building that contains only 1 living space, perhaps on 2 or 3 storeys. If the building is only 1 storey, it\u2019s called a bungalow.Private room: A room in a person\u2019s home. When you rent a private room, you get access to a shared kitchen, bathroom and sometimes other parts of the home, such as the living room. This can be an affordable way to rent. Some homeowners may also include \u201cboard\u201d with your private room. This means they will provide you with 1 or more meals per day.Den: A small room, with or without a door. Many apartments consist of 1 bedroom, plus den. You could use a den as a living room, office or for storage.Ensuite (bathroom): A bathroom that you can directly access from the bedroom. Some apartments have an ensuite bathroom and a 2nd bathroom for guests.Powder room: A small bathroom with only a toilet and sink (no shower or bathtub). A full bathroom always includes a shower or bathtub.AC: Air-conditioner. Many parts of Canada are hot in the summer, but not all apartments or homes have AC.Furnished: Rent for the apartment or house will include basic furniture like a couch, table and bed. A stove and refrigerator will also be supplied, and perhaps a dishwasher, clothes dryer and washer.Unfurnished: Rent for the apartment or home may include a stove, fridge, dishwasher and other appliances. Be sure to ask what your rent includes. An unfurnished rental means the rooms will be empty when you move in, so you need to supply your own furniture.\u00a0Utilities: Utilities refer to electricity (often called hydro in Canada), water, heat and AC. It\u2019s important to know whether you or the landlord pays for utilities. Sometimes, rent includes utilities (the landlord pays). Sometimes, the tenant pays for them based on the amount of electricity, heat or water they use each month.Lease: A contract between you and your landlord that sets out the rent and how long you will live in the apartment or house.Sublet: If your lease has not expired and you want to leave the apartment or house, you can reach a new agreement with someone to assume the lease until it expires. They\u2019ll be subletting the apartment from you. Be sure to ask your landlord for permission to sublet your apartment."

It may be as much as one month\u2019s rent. In fact, it can be any amount your landlord decides to charge:If you damage the housing during your lease, the landlord keeps the amount of the damage deposit to pay for repairs to the unit (if the damage costs more than your deposit amount, you will be responsible for paying for it).If you do not damage the housing, the landlord returns the amount of the damage deposit to you at the end of your lease."
